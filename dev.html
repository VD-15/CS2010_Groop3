            Hey everyone, watch out! We’re taking over with our brand-new game, Takeover! Bad puns aside, we are T3, Team 3 of CS2010 (a very creative team name I know). This marks our first of many blog posts in which we will update you where we are in the development of our game.
            <br> <br>
            Creating the game concept for Takeover was no easy task, we just had so many ideas for our game which made it difficult to decide for what kind of game we wanted to create. However, after much thought about this matter, T3 presents... Takeover!
            <br> <br>
            Gamers! Do you think you have what it takes? Partake in this galactic war between factions and play as a warlord to reign supreme over your opponent! Takeover is a suspenseful Sci-Fi Real-time Player Vs Player strategy game, play as your chosen commander and dominate all your foes. Build different units to make up your army and defeat the opposing enemy by claiming all that is theirs and finally defeating the opponent’s own commander, it’s a 1 vs 1 battle to see who is the best! See how well you do control and managing your army and expanding your empire but let me tell you now this is no easy task!
            <br> <br>
            So there you have it, this is the game concept which we came up with for now and of course we will only continue to make our game even better to ensure a thrilling game experience for our gamers. But for now, we’ll keep you updated by posting updates on what’s happening with the game and how the development is going through these blog posts, therefore stay tuned!

            In today’s meeting we all got together to work on the pitch for your game to decide if our game is a viable idea to further develop on or not. Today we discussed and fleshed out our game even more by talking about what the game actually is and if we can actually implement some ideas or not, we all had really amazing ideas that we would love to add to the game but we had to be realistic and had to scrap a lot ideas as we are a small group and don’t have a vast knowledge on coding. We all developed a script for our pitch where we discusses what our game is, what you can do in our game and what you have to do in order to succeed, we also touched up on the lore a little bit more where we discussed more about the characters and their personality and motives. All these ideas are yet not finalised and in our next meeting we should be complete in what our goal is.

            Hey guys! So, in our previous team meeting our team had fun coming up with our game’s character, story and game mechanic designs. We managed to finalize our design for the commanders in which the players could play; giving each commander their own distinct personality and traits which make them unique.
            <br> <br>
            We also touched on the mechanics of the game and came up with a gist of the different units which the player can build and control but still subject to change, on top of quarries and factory designs. There will be four different units, walker/fighter, walker/ranged, flying and vehicle units.

            Working towards more on the game development of Takeover. The team finished creating a UML diagram of the different entities which we will be planning to implement within the following weeks for the hack. In addition to making a start on the development of the website in which we will be using to promote Takeover.

            Picking up from last week the team started working on the hack that we will need to submit in a couple of week time. Our team has decided to use Lightweight Java Game Library (LWJGL) to create our game’s engine, our plan is to focus on building the foundation of the game engine with the main goal to implement the basic game logic of Takeover and avoiding as much complications as possible before the submission of the hack. After the submission of the hack we will focus on the other complex implementations of Takeover such as 3D rendering capabilities, creating unit models etc.
            <br><br>
            The website side of things are looking a bit rough as the website team want to add a live running video on the index page to show what in game looks like but they are having trouble adding this feature as when they add the video to the background they can’t seem to get text over it, instead it gets pushed down ruining the design of the website, the team has decided to fix this in their own time and if not they will go back to the intended design.

            Today the website team gave it one more shot in trying to implement their video idea, which did not work In the end so what they decided to do is go back to the original idea and try to implement it on a separate website so it doesn’t affect the project website and if successful they will add it to the current website. One of the team members is still trying to build and flesh out the custom game engine idea that we came up with to get extra creativity marks. We have also assigned people to the documentations side and who is writing what section of the documentation which are the game design document and software quality strategy.

            Today’s meeting, we had a lot to discuss as we are facing a very big issue on the game development side and the website side of things. On Saturday we got a message from the team member developing the custom engine informing us on a serious problem which can take a very long time to fix and the dead line is closing in on us and we have yet not got any of the game developed yet and we need to start it. The issue in question is that the developer is getting driver crashes and also the compatibility of the engine is a huge risk and the developer believes has unable to diagnose the problem. He gave us 2 options on how we can move forward as a team to create the game
            <br><br>
            Option 1:  Transition over to C/C++ in which fortunately, we have a back-up custom game engine.
            <br><br>
            Option 2: Switch over to Unity.
            <br><br>
            And today we discussed what path to take and we spoke about the pros and cons of each path, unity may be the easiest one to develop a game on, but it is hard to maintain with git as it creates a lot of temporary files. We chose to take the C/C++ path as the developer has a backup custom engine that works and also, he has a very good understanding of that language and he can write us a document on how C/C++ works and the basic syntax on how to code in it.
            <br><br>
            We hope the path we chose Is the right one.
            <br><br>
            On the other hand the website team is having an issue with the resizing of the boxes in the commander section of the website as it is not compatible with different screen sizes which they need to fix as we want to reach as many people as possible and make it viewable on all screen sizes and they are now discussing on what to do next in order to solve this problem.

            It’s been a tough week for everyone, problems, problems, problems!
            <br><br>
            But fortunately enough, the game development is finally starting and coming along very good and we have a very basic skeleton of the game which is viable enough for the submission on the 10th of this month. The website team has filled in the website with content and has gotten rid of filler text and put something meaningful in the fields, the issue of resizing has yet not been fixed. The documentation is coming along very well, and everything is nearly completed except for a few empty sections which can be filled with text in 2 hours of work.

            This is the day we have the meeting with the mentors for this project and they will give us feedback and advice on our submission luckily, we have submitted everything on time and completed.
            <br><br>
            We have been told we have a huge flaw with our structure with in the team and our development process which we lack of, we have also been told we don’t have the sense of completion as somethings have been not fully been written out and coming out of these meetings we have realised what we need to do to get the higher marks and be better as a team. Straight after the meeting with the mentors we decided to have a group meeting and address the issues and improve our group structure.
            <br><br>
            What we have done is added milestones on our GitHub and assigned each other to those milestones so we always know what we have to do and know what the others are doing. We have divided people into sub groups within our group to work on a common goal which are the game development team and the website team and each team has set up their own tasks and everyone can see it and assign that task to themselves so everyone in the group knows that, that specific task is being worked on.
            <br><br>
            We have also addressed the issue with the lack of a development process, and we have set one up now and implemented it on our GitHub which is the Kanban process.
            <br><br>
            The website has been addressed with the sense of completion by removing all filler text and actually adding meaningful text to the website giving it a complete feel.
            <br><br>
            Overall, we got some great feedback from the mentors and we have worked on the feedback and now we have much more structure within our team, and we can show the structure to anyway with simply opening up our GitHub page.

            A discord has also been set up to improve workflow and power. Having a discord allows our team members to better inter-communicate with one another in their respectful sub-teams, collaborating becomes easier and performing work can become more efficient. Discord also help us to have a conversation and share resources much better than our previous method of communication which was WhatsApp.
            <br><br>
            Another big issue has been resolved which was the resizing of the website which now after long period of stress all of the website resizes, and it fits all screens from laptops screens all the way down to iphone 5 screens.
            <br><br>
            Our new goal is to work towards the MVP submission which is on 13/12/2019 where we have to demo our game to a crowd and also have a complete website with a development blog.

            Hello everyone, hope all you all had a wonderful weekend! There really isn’t anything much to report, main goals right now are to start creating map designs and unit models along with implementing 3D rendering in terms of in-game development and designing a user-friendly UI for the game. If anything, else happens, you can be sure we’ll let you know!

            Yes! After a long week of battling with trying to achieve 3D rendering capabilities for the game engine, we did it! Takeover’s game engine now has cell shading capabilities along with basic material support, and textures. In addition to slight tweaks to help improve performance, models are now stored in video memory to help better performance.

            Final main menu design is now complete along with a 3D Map for the battle arena for Takeover. Goals we’re walking towards regarding in-game development are as follows:
            <br><br>
            Implement quarries & factories that produce & consume resources
            <br>
            •	Need factories to consume resources (need not produce anything yet)
            <br>
            •	Need quarries to produce resources

            Today the website time is finally coming to an end where they are finalising the website design and implementations of things all they need to do is add little improvements to it. The game is coming along well although we have a lot of work in that section to do so as soon as the website team is done with that, they will be joining the game team and work together to get it done as soon as possible.
