# Script:

> Takeover is a real time, PvP strategy game with an emphasis on appropriating enemy resources & bases. Set in a universe torn apart by a devestating war between four intergalactic factions, the discovery of a new system promises to turn the tide of battle.

> You play as one of a variety of commanders each with their own unique personality & abilities. Tasked with colonising this new frontier & exterminating all who stand in your way. 

> Will you choose Valkyria; an experienced warrior who commands the ebb and flow of the battlefield. She can read her opponent like an open book and strike directly at their heart. Make a mistake, and you **will** be at her mercy.

> Or will you choose P3-TR; the cold, calculated A.I. who never quite learned what surrender meant. Programmed to kill with relentless efficiency and malice. Be weary is you cross P3-TR on the battlefield, because it may well be the last thing you ever do.

> Or perhaps Karan; who fights head-on with brute force and with little regard for her own units. Should she catch sight of your commander, do not expect her to let them live.

> What about Zhoron who carries the lineage of his people on his shoulders. He fights to protect his homeworld and all they have built from the invasive forces of the enemy factions. You may take what is his, but he will take more in return.

> Build factories, create armies and send them into battle in a race against your opponent. Fight over increasingly scarce resources and land as you wage a grand skirmish across entire planets.

> Be sure to guard your empire closely, your work is prime for the taking and with finite resources available, your oppenent might just take yours. Will you raze their factories to the ground or take them for yourself as you fight a grualing war to the death? The choice is yours...

> We are Third Tier and we will see you on the battlefield!
